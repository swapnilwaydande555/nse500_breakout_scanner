# NSE500 Breakout Scanner (Minimal Deployable)

This is a minimal, ready-to-deploy scaffold for an NSE-500 Breakout Scanner using public market data (Yahoo/NSE endpoints).
It provides a Streamlit dashboard, a background scheduler script, a simple backtest stub, and Telegram alert integration hooks.

**Important:** This is a deployable starting point. For production you should review rate limits, add robust error handling, and secure secrets.

**Quick start**
1. Upload this repo to GitHub.
2. Deploy to Render (or Streamlit Cloud). See `delivery.md` for detailed, click-by-click steps.
